            <p>Hi, my name is David! Here's a few things about me: I served in the Army for 6 years. Supply and logitics has been main main career path for the last 9+ years. I've decided to make the switch into coding and programming because it's always been a passion of mine to learn. I'm not getting any younger!</p>
